# Electronic-Shelf-Label-Firebase-Edition

An electronic shelf label (ESL) is a type of price tag. The one that enables you to easily set and update the product name, pricing, product description, etc.

The ESL that I've developed enables you to showcase up to 195 characters of relevant product information. It is comprised of only two components: ESP8266 and a 1.77-inch TFT LCD with ST7735.

As for the number of ESLs you can operate. Technically, this particular ESL allows you to operate as many of them as you wish, provided that each has its own unique ID, they all share the same cryptographic key, and there's enough power and bandwidth for all of them.
